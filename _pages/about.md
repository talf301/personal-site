I'm a PhD student in the Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) lab at UCLA, working with Prof. [Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/){:target="\_blank"}. I am broadly interested in techniques and models for probabilistic reasoning, at the intersection of probability and logic. In particular, I have an interest in Probabilistic Databases, Probabilistic Programming, Graphical Models, and Knowledge Compilation.

Before moving to LA to pursue a PhD, I lived in Toronto where I grew up and got my [BSc. in Computer Science and Math](https://www.utoronto.ca/
