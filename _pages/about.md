I'm a PhD student in the Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) lab at UCLA, working with [Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/){:target="\_blank"}. I am broadly interested in techniques and models for probabilistic reasoning, at the intersection of probability and logic. In particular, I have an interest in Probabilistic Databases, Probabilistic Programming, Graphical Models, and Knowledge Compilation.

Before joining UCLA for grad school, I got my BSc. in Computer Science and Math from University of Toronto, where I worked with [Michael Brudno](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~brudno/public/){:target="\_blank"} and [Anna Goldenberg](http://goldenberglab.ca/){:target="\_blank"}.
